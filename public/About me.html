<h1>About Me</h1>
<h3>I'm not in my right mind. Thank You</h3>
<p>It's time for a change in my art journey. My creative passions tend to evolve frequently, and currently, I find myself drawn to moles, piercings, and vibrant colors. While I'm eager to explore the world of digital art, I'm currently dedicated to traditional art.</p>

<p>As for my background, my résumé might seem a bit unconventional. My skills include maniacal laughter, crafting elaborate monologues about evil plans, and a deep knowledge of Canadian history. Although I can't see myself pursuing a career in catering, I'm excited to channel my unique experiences and interests into my chaotic life.</p>
